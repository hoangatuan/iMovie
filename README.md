This is a SwiftUI project that applies **Modular Architect & Clean Architect**. For the presentation layer, I'm using **MVVM-C**.  
Supports iOS 16+

## Preface

The purpose I developing this project is I want it to be used as a reference for large scale production apps.
Because of that, I don't spend too much efforts in building UI, so the UI is not fancy üòõ

## Key Features

- Presentation layer: SwiftUI + MVVM-C + Modern concurrency
- Clean architecture: Decoupled Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access layers
- Modular architecture
- Navigation using `NavigationStack`
- Dependency Injection using `CompositionRoot` approach, `DIContainer` & constructor injection to support testing.
- Cover with unit tests, [snapshot testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
- Designed for scalability. It can be used as a reference for building large production apps   

### Inovates üí°

- Use Swift Macros to remove duplicate codes

For Clean Architecture, theoratically we should have `UseCaseInterface` and `UseCaseImplementation`. However, at this point I feel like bringing `Usecase` as an extra layer is unncessary.  
If we feel like need `Usecase` layer in future, we will add it.

## Why MVVM but not TCA, Redux, ... ?

Please read [this great article](https://betterprogramming.pub/swiftui-choosing-an-application-architecture-6ec9289f8e8f) from @Michael Long. I pretty much agreed with his thoughts.

# Getting Started

## Set up project

After clone the project, navigate to the project directory, then run this command:

```bash
    make
```

And that's all you need to do to set up the project üöÄ
