This is a SwiftUI project that apply Modular Architect & Clean Architect. For the presentation layer, I'm using MVVM.   
Supports iOS 16+

## Key Features

- Presentation layer: SwiftUI + MVVM-C + Modern concurrency
- Clean architecture: Decoupled Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access layers
- Modular architecture
- Navigation using `NavigationStack`
- Data persistence with SwiftData (planning)
- Dependency Injection using `DIContainer` & constructor injection to support testing. Using [Factory](https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory) to support DI.
- Designed for scalability. It can be used as a reference for building large production apps

For Clean Architecture, theoratically we should have `UseCaseInterface` and `UseCaseImplementation`. However, at this point I feel like bringing `Usecase` as an extra layer is unncessary.  
If we feel like need `Usecase` layer in future, we will add it.
