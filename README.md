- Clean architecture: Decoupled Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access layers
- Modular architecture
- Navigation using `NavigationStack`
- Data persistence with SwiftData (planning)
- Dependency Injection using `DIContainer` & constructor injection to support testing. Using [Factory](https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory) to support DI.
- Designed for scalability. It can be used as a reference for building large production apps
